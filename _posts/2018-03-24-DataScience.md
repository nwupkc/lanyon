title: Why Data Science?

## Where did it all begin

I studied Mathematics, Economics, and Finance in college, and like everybody else who were taking the same classes, I wanted to become an investment banker or a management consultant.  These two career choices were the most popular among the students in my college, as evident from a list of firms attending our career days and the opportunities offered on our job posting site.

As a rite of passage for those who want to go into finance, I did an internship my sophomore year. I actually took on two internships at the same time. One internship was at an investment bank, and another was at an insurance startup. From 8 to 5, I would commute to the investment bank in downtown Chicago and work the whole day. When I came back home, I would eat dinner and work remotely for the startup. (In hindsight, a lot of the day-to-day job I did for these three months could have been automated given the programming skills I have today.)

I did gain a tremendous experience doing both internships, but I was burnt out after that summer. I was totally drained both physically and emotionally. Consequently, I did not have it in me to put my full effort into recruitment the following quarter. I was frantic to keep up with school work while looking for opportunities at my dream companies, but the more I tried, I got exhausted even more. I had to watch my peers get internships at top firms left and right, while my efforts resulted in nothing.

When I was distressed, I had an urge to clean my surroundings. I had so much going on in my head, but since it was hard to clear my mind and let go of my ambitions, I opted for an easier option of getting rid of my possessions. I did not have a ton of belongings to begin with, but my possessions increased steadily year after year, following me around every time I moved. I was tired of moving, tired of things I owned, and tired of everything in my life.

The hardest to get rid of were my books, the sign of my intellectual snobbery. I mistakenly believed that the books on my shelf defined who I was even though I have not read majority of them. I kept them just because of the slim chance of one day picking them up and actually reading them. I was wrong. I never got around to doing that, and it did not seem likely that I would. It felt like a waste to throw away unread books, so I read them before throwing them out. This ironically led to a period when I read the most books in my life, thus far.

It took me a while for me to admit that I needed a break. Deep down I knew, but I ignored my natural urges for what I thought would result in a better future. This did work for a while because I got good grades, went to a good school, and got recognized for my hard work. But I overworked myself, and it finally came to a point where I could not ignore my true feelings anymore.

## Transitional phase

I did finally take a break that spring quarter my junior year and went backpacking to Barcelona. My long time dream was becoming an architect, and my hero was Antonio Gaudí, whose works are mostly located in Barcelona. I went to go see every single work by Gaudi, and came to a long overdue realization that I was actually interested in Gaudí's architecture, not architecture itself. I had a proper closure on my childhood dream.

I met many people along the way and was able to hear their life stories. They came from all kinds of different professional backgrounds ranging from dentistry to marketing. All of them quit their jobs to travel the world. Talking to them gave me the consolations that I needed. Back at school, I was always surrounded by overachievers who did not know what "pause" meant, but here I was able to meet like-minded individuals who came to the same realization that working oneself to death should not be one's sole purpose in life.

I came to a realization that early success, while praiseworthy, is not everything. Early success does not necessarily mean greater success later in life. If you are burnt out as a result of the early success, you may not achieve your full potential. In a way, I am glad that my breakdown happened earlier on in my life. The result would have been far more detrimental if I was a working professional or have a family of my own.

I stayed at home during that summer and I got into philosophy. I needed answers in my life, and I tried to find them in the works of the greatest minds in history including Plato, Aristotle, Confucius and Mencius. It did not give me answers to all my questions, but it did make me grow as a person. It was also a humbling experience to get exposure to things that are hard to wrap my head around.

## Why data science

I went back to school as a senior still without any idea what I want to do with my life. Midway through my senior year, I read an article on data science. It sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I tried to pick up the required skills on my own, but it was hard to make time to solely focus on data science while I was still in school. I made a complete 180 degree turn on my career interest to a field where I have close to no experience. I wanted an internship, but I was in a Catch-22 situation where firms were looking for people with experience while I wanted to work for them to get experience.

Therefore, I decided to study data science on my own during the summer. I was familiar with Stata from Econometrics courses, so my natural language of choice was a close relative, R. I read statistical learning books while working on independent projects. I am not going to lie; it was one of the hardest things I did in my life. It was difficult because there was no guidance whatsoever. I did not know what concepts were more important, so I read the whole book from cover to cover. The lists of skills that seemed necessary for practicing data science was overwhelming. Despite all that, I kept going at it. I woke up, sat down, read, and coded.

I went back to school as a super senior due to that break from school. I could have graduated on time if I gave up on one of my two majors or certificate, but I wanted to finish what I started. My interest in data science continued. I was more familiar with data science concepts, but I felt under-prepared. I talked to one of my old friend who was still in school because he took a gap year. He strongly recommended doing a bootcamp from his own experience.

I drew the good old T-diagram to weigh the pros and cons. I was leaning more towards the data science bootcamp but was initially hesitant because of the tuitioin and I knew that I could learn on my own from my experience in the summer. On the other hand, it was the first time in my life where my interest in one field lasted this long, and I wanted to give data science a serious try. After much thought, I eventually chose bootcamp. I can confidently say that it is by far the best decision I made in my life. I learned so much, and it expedited the learning process by order of magnitudes. While college courses emphasized theoretical aspects of learning, the bootcamp focuses on practical applications which was exactly what I was looking for.

I found a profession that I can proudly call my "calling". I know it takes people years or even their entire life to find something that they are passionate about, so I am very glad that I found data science early on. The more I learn about data science, the more I realize that I chose the right path. While data science is challenging, I find it rewarding and fun. I think I found my _ikigai_, a Japanese word that roughly translates into "a thing that brings satisfaction and meaning to life, essentially a thing that makes life worth living". The description of _ikigai_ usually comes with this venn diagram and for me, data science lies in the intersection of all four circles.
