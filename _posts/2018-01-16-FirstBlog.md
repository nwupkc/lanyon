It has been a hectic week at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. I started this blog to reflect back at my experience and to record what I learned along the way. With the help of our instructors Julie and Vinny, 25 comrades finished the first week successfully.

This week we covered:
- __Python/Pandas__
- __Git/GitHub__
- __Matplotlib/Seaborn__

Two things you should be wary of at the bootcamp are __perfectionism__ and __imposter syndrome__. Perfectionism is self-explanatory, and imposter syndrome means the feeling of not belonging to a group. Imposter syndrome derives from being surrounded by qualified individuals, and it often results in playing oneself down. I had to give up on perfectionistism long time ago in order to survive, and I thought I was past imposter syndrome being always surrounded by people smarter than me. I was wrong. I had to fight both impulses from day 1 at Metis. As time passed though, I realized that people are going to be on different learning curves and it is natural to feel such ways.

Getting to the main business, we were given our first project and it involves looking at NYC MTA Turnstiles data and other external data to recommend stations to a fictional company called WomenTechWomenYes to engage their fundraising efforts in. After a week of analyses, we came up with top popular stations with the highest expected average givings for our final recommendations:

1. __Grand Central__
2. __Herald Square__
3. __Union Square__

The deliverable for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nwupkc/MTA).

The people in my cohort is an invaluable asset that I earned at the bootcamp. They are going to support me during and after the bootcamp. They will most likely travel the same path after graduation. Given all that, I made it my goal to meet every single person in my cohort. We get paired every morning to do a coding project which helps. Moreover, I deliberately did not bring lunch, so I can meet more people (okay, I might start bringing my own lunch to prevent leaving a hole in my wallet).
