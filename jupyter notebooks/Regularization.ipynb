    "__Why Regularization__ Regularizing (or shrinking) the coefficients estimates towards zero can significantly reduce their variance and thus fix overfitting. Overfitting occurs when there is low bias and high variance. Complex models can lead to overfitting the data, which means they follow the errors, or noise in data, too closely. This results in low training error but high testing error. Consequently, overfitting results in poor predictions on unseen data. What regularization does is that it awards goodness of fit while penalizing model complexity."

    "The difference, $\\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$, is a shrinkage penalty (also called $l_2$ norm) which essentially penalizes having high $\\beta$s. When $\\lambda=0$ our ridge regression is equivalent to the least square regression. As $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias. When $\\lambda\\rightarrow\\infty$, the ridge regression coefficient estimates will approach zero. Notice that the shrinkage penalty is not applied to $\\beta_0$. This is because we do not want to shrink the intercept, which is the mean output when $x_{i1} = x_{i2} = \\ldots = x_{ip} = 0$."

    "The lasso uses an $l_1$ penalty, $\\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|$, while the ridge uses an $l_2$ penalty. In the case of the lasso, the $l_1$ penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large. The lasso performs variable selection and thus yields sparse model meaning model involve only a subset of the variables. This gives us a huge advantage in model interpretation."
