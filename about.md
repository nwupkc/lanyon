Hi, I'm PK.

I am a recent (Dec '17) graduate from Northwestern. I studied Mathematics, Economics, and Finance at Northwestern, and now I am a Data Scientist at Metis. Metis is an immersive Data Science Bootcamp in New York covering Machine Learning, Statistics, Programming, and many more! I created this blog to share my experience and insights gained throughout my journey.

Thanks for reading!
