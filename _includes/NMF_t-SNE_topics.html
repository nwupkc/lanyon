philosopher Yu said, \"They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. ","\"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\"  ","Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.  ","The Master said, \"I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\"  ","Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'\" ","The Master said, \"Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.

In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.

By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort.

If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone.

Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace.

He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous.

Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.  ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"On what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?\"  ","The Master said, \"He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan.\"  ","The Master said of Tsze-ch'an that he had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in serving his superior, he was respectful; in nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just.\"  ","The Master said, \"Yen P'ing knew well how to maintain friendly intercourse. The acquaintance might be long, but he showed the same respect as at first.\"  ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills made, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.-Of what sort was his wisdom?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked, saying, \"The minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance.

Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"Po-i and Shu-ch'i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the resentments directed towards them were few.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who says of Weishang Kao that he is upright? One begged some vinegar of him, and he begged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.\"  ","Yen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, \"Come, let each of you tell his wishes.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"I should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur clothes, to share them with my friends, and though they should spoil them, I would not be displeased.\"  ","Yen Yuan said, \"I should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds.\"  ","Tsze-lu then said, \"I should like, sir, to hear your wishes.\" The Master said, \"They are, in regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is all over.

The Master said, \"He may pass. He does not mind small matters.\"  ","Chung-kung said, \"If a man cherish in himself a reverential feeling of the necessity of attention to business, though he may be easy in small matters in his government of the people, that may be allowed. But if he cherish in himself that easy feeling, and also carry it out in his practice, is not such an easymode of procedure excessive?\" ","The Master said, \"Yung's words are right.\"  The Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn. ","Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger; he did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not such another. I have not yet heard of any one who loves to learn as he did.\"  ","Tsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch'i, the disciple Zan requested grain for his mother. The Master said, \"Give her a fu.\" Yen requested more. \"Give her a yi,\" said the Master. Yen gave her five ping.

The others may attain to this on some days or in some months, but nothing more.\" ","Chi K'ang asked about Chung-yu, whether he was fit to be employed as an officer of government. The Master said, \"Yu is a man of decision; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" K'ang asked, \"Is Ts'ze fit to be employed as an officer of government?\" and was answered, \"Ts'ze is a man of intelligence; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" And to the same question about Ch'iu the Master gave the same reply, saying, \"Ch'iu is a man of various ability.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family sent to ask Min Tsze-ch'ien to be governor of Pi.

He took hold of his hand through the window, and said, \"It is killing him. It is the appointment of Heaven, alas! That such a man should have such a sickness! That such a man should have such a sickness!\"  ","The Master said, \"Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\"  ","Yen Ch'iu said, \"It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\" The Master said, \"Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-hsia, \"Do you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the mean man.\" ","Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, \"Have you got good men there?\" He answered, \"There is Tan-t'ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on public business.\"  ","The Master said, \"Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit.

My horse would not advance.\"  ","The Master said, \"Without the specious speech of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escape in the present age.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced.

There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.

If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan.

If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.

Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands.

Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. ","\"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing  anything about them?\" ","The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with Wan. ","The Master, having heard of it, said, \"He deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\" ","The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, \"Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\" ","Confucius said, \"The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral  temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with  such officers as these, how should he lose his state?\" ","The Master said, \"He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\" ","Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \"Chan  Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.\" ","The duke said, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.\" Confucius retired, and said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers,  I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, \"Inform  the chiefs of the three families of it.\" ","He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\" ","Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \"Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.\" ","The Master said, \"The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\" ","The Master said, \"In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. ","Tsze-kung said, \"Master, that is what you yourself say.\" Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said,  \"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? ","Confucius said, \"I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\" ","The Master said, \"A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\" ","Some one said, \"What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\" ","The Master said, \"With what then will you recompense kindness?\" \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\" ","The Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Tsze-kung said, \"What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has  simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water  must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.'\" ","The Master said, \"How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without  speaking?\" ","The Master said, \"Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? ","\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\" ","Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash. The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.\" ","The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools.  When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among  its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its  scholars.\" ","Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. ","The Master said, \"Follow the seasons of Hsia. \"Ride in the state carriage of Yin. \"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau. \"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious;  specious talkers are dangerous.\" ","The Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" ","The Master said, \"It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" ","The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\" ","The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can indeed do nothing with him!\" ","The Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs is indeed a hard case.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a superior man.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.\" ","The Master said, \"What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the man.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?\" The Master said, \"Is not Reciprocity such a word?

The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.\" ","The Master said, \"Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Let every man consider virtue as what devolves on himself.

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, \"Our chief,  Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? \"Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with attacking it? \" ","Zan Yu said, \"Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers  wishes it.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. ","\"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. ","\"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\" ","Confucius said, \"When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies,  music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven.  When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations. ","\"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the great officers. ","\"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the common people.\" ","Confucius said, \"The revenue of the state has left the ducal house now for five generations. The government has been in the hands of the great  officers for four generations. On this account, the descendants of the  three Hwan are much reduced.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship with the uplight; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:-these are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious.  To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:-these are advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;-this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak;-this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-this is called blindness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages. ","\"The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of sages.\" ","Confucius said, \"Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those who learn, and so readily get possession of knowledge, are the next. Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn;-they are the lowest of the people.\" ","Confucius said, \"The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be  sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should  be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties his anger may involve him in.

","\"I have heard only these two things from him.\" Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, \"I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the Odes.

","The Master said, \"If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire.

Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds.

","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure.

Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him.

The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it.

According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field-allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of eight mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State, where these results were seen, the old wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.\"","The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. ","(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. ","Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. ","Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful. ","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. ","So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. ","Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. ","All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). ","The work is done, but how no one can see; 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be. ","Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. ","Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. ","He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal. ","The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! ","We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! ","I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God. ","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to

philosopher Yu said, \"They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. ","\"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\"  ","Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.  ","The Master said, \"I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\"  ","Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'\" ","The Master said, \"Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.  ","\"If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name?  ","\"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\"  ","The Master said: \"He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?\"  ","The Master said, \"A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known.\"  ","The Master said, \"Shan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity.\" The disciple Tsang replied, \"Yes.\"  ","The Master went out, and the other disciples asked, saying, \"What do his words mean?\" Tsang said, \"The doctrine of our master is to be true to the principles-of our nature and the benevolent exercise of them to others,-this and nothing more.\"  ","The Master said, \"The mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with gain.\" ","The Master said, \"When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.\"  ","The Master said, \"While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.  ","The Master said of Tsze-chien, \"Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?\"  ","Tsze-kung asked, \"What do you say of me, Ts'ze!\" The Master said, \"You are a utensil.\" \"What utensil?\" \"A gemmed sacrificial utensil.\" ","Some one said, \"Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\"  ","The Master said, \"What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?\"  ","The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \"I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this.\" The Master was pleased.  ","The Master said, \"My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\" Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \"Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \"I do not know.\"  ","He asked again, when the Master replied, \"In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"And what do you say of Ch'iu?\" The Master replied, \"In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"What do you say of Ch'ih?\" The Master replied, \"With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-kung, \"Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"How dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I hear one point, and know a second.\"  ","The Master said, \"You are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him.\"  ","Tsai Yu being asleep during the daytime, the Master said, \"Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?\"  ","The Master said, \"At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.  ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"On what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?\"  ","The Master said, \"He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan.\"  ","The Master said of Tsze-ch'an that he had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in serving his superior, he was respectful; in nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just.\"  ","The Master said, \"Yen P'ing knew well how to maintain friendly intercourse. The acquaintance might be long, but he showed the same respect as at first.\"  ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills made, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.-Of what sort was his wisdom?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked, saying, \"The minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance. Thrice he retired from office, and manifested no displeasure. He made it a point to inform the new minister of the way in which he had conducted the government; what do you say of him?\" The Master replied. \"He was loyal.\" \"Was he perfectly virtuous?\" \"I do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Tsze-chang proceeded, \"When the officer Ch'ui killed the prince of Ch'i, Ch'an Wan, though he was the owner of forty horses, abandoned them and left the country. Coming to another state, he said, 'They are here like our great officer, Ch'ui,' and left it. He came to a second state, and with the same observation left it also;-what do you say of him?\" The Master replied, \"He was pure.\" \"Was he perfectly virtuous?\" \"I do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Chi Wan thought thrice, and then acted. When the Master was informed of it, he said, \"Twice may do.\"  ","The Master said, \"When good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of a wise man. When his country was in disorder, he acted the part of a stupid man. Others may equal his wisdom, but they cannot equal his stupidity.\"  ","When the Master was in Ch'an, he said, \"Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"Po-i and Shu-ch'i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the resentments directed towards them were few.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who says of Weishang Kao that he is upright? One begged some vinegar of him, and he begged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.\"  ","Yen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, \"Come, let each of you tell his wishes.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"I should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur clothes, to share them with my friends, and though they should spoil them, I would not be displeased.\"  ","Yen Yuan said, \"I should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds.\"  ","Tsze-lu then said, \"I should like, sir, to hear your wishes.\" The Master said, \"They are, in regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is all over. I have not yet seen one who could perceive his faults, and inwardly accuse himself.\"  ","The Master said, \"In a hamlet of ten families, there may be found one honorable and sincere as I am, but not so fond of learning.\" ","The Master said, \"There is Yung!-He might occupy the place of a prince.\" ","Chung-kung asked about Tsze-sang Po-tsze. The Master said, \"He may pass. He does not mind small matters.\"  ","Chung-kung said, \"If a man cherish in himself a reverential feeling of the necessity of attention to business, though he may be easy in small matters in his government of the people, that may be allowed. But if he cherish in himself that easy feeling, and also carry it out in his practice, is not such an easymode of procedure excessive?\" ","The Master said, \"Yung's words are right.\"  The Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn. ","Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger; he did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not such another. I have not yet heard of any one who loves to learn as he did.\"  ","Tsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch'i, the disciple Zan requested grain for his mother. The Master said, \"Give her a fu.\" Yen requested more. \"Give her a yi,\" said the Master. Yen gave her five ping. ","The Master said, \"When Ch'ih was proceeding to Ch'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich.\" ","Yuan Sze being made governor of his town by the Master, he gave him nine hundred measures of grain, but Sze declined them.  ","The Master said, \"Do not decline them. May you not give them away in the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and villages?\"  ","The Master, speaking of Chung-kung, said, \"If the calf of a brindled cow be red and homed, although men may not wish to use it, would the spirits of the mountains and rivers put it aside?\"  ","The Master said, \"Such was Hui that for three months there would be nothing in his mind contrary to perfect virtue. The others may attain to this on some days or in some months, but nothing more.\" ","Chi K'ang asked about Chung-yu, whether he was fit to be employed as an officer of government. The Master said, \"Yu is a man of decision; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" K'ang asked, \"Is Ts'ze fit to be employed as an officer of government?\" and was answered, \"Ts'ze is a man of intelligence; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" And to the same question about Ch'iu the Master gave the same reply, saying, \"Ch'iu is a man of various ability.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family sent to ask Min Tsze-ch'ien to be governor of Pi. Min Tszech'ien said, \"Decline the offer for me politely. If any one come again to me with a second invitation, I shall be obliged to go and live on the banks of the Wan.\"  ","Po-niu being ill, the Master went to ask for him. He took hold of his hand through the window, and said, \"It is killing him. It is the appointment of Heaven, alas! That such a man should have such a sickness! That such a man should have such a sickness!\"  ","The Master said, \"Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\"  ","Yen Ch'iu said, \"It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\" The Master said, \"Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-hsia, \"Do you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the mean man.\" ","Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, \"Have you got good men there?\" He answered, \"There is Tan-t'ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on public business.\"  ","The Master said, \"Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, \"It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance.\"  ","The Master said, \"Without the specious speech of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escape in the present age.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\"  ","Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu.

A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.

When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping.

My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. ","\"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing  anything about them?\" ","The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with Wan. ","The Master, having heard of it, said, \"He deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\" ","The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, \"Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\" ","Confucius said, \"The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral  temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with  such officers as these, how should he lose his state?\" ","The Master said, \"He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\" ","Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \"Chan  Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.\" ","The duke said, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.\" Confucius retired, and said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers,  I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, \"Inform  the chiefs of the three families of it.\" ","He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\" ","Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \"Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.\" ","The Master said, \"The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\" ","The Master said, \"In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. ","Tsze-kung said, \"Master, that is what you yourself say.\" Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said,  \"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? ","Confucius said, \"I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\" ","The Master said, \"A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\" ","Some one said, \"What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\" ","The Master said, \"With what then will you recompense kindness?\" \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\" ","The Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Tsze-kung said, \"What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has  simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water  must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.'\" ","The Master said, \"How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without  speaking?\" ","The Master said, \"Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North.

They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-this is called blindness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness.

Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh.

It has never been that the ruler of a State, where these results were seen, the old wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.\"","The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. ","(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. ","Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. ","Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful. ","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. ","So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. ","Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. ","All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). ","The work is done, but how no one can see; 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be. ","Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. ","Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. ","He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal. ","The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! ","We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! ","I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God. ","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to
