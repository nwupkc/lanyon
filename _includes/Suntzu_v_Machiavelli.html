There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. ","\"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\"  ","Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.  ","The Master said, \"I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\"  ","Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'\" ","The Master said, \"Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.  ","\"If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name?  ","\"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\"  ","The Master said: \"He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?\"  ","The Master said, \"A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known.\"  ","The Master said, \"Shan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity.\" The disciple Tsang replied, \"Yes.\"  ","The Master went out, and the other disciples asked, saying, \"What do his words mean?\" Tsang said, \"The doctrine of our master is to be true to the principles-of our nature and the benevolent exercise of them to others,-this and nothing more.\"  ","The Master said, \"The mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with gain.\" ","The Master said, \"When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.\"  ","The Master said, \"While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.  ","The Master said of Tsze-chien, \"Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?\"  ","Tsze-kung asked, \"What do you say of me, Ts'ze!\" The Master said, \"You are a utensil.\" \"What utensil?\" \"A gemmed sacrificial utensil.\" ","Some one said, \"Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\"  ","The Master said, \"What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?\"  ","The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \"I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this.\" The Master was pleased.  ","The Master said, \"My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\" Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \"Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \"I do not know.\"  ","He asked again, when the Master replied, \"In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"And what do you say of Ch'iu?\" The Master replied, \"In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"What do you say of Ch'ih?\" The Master replied, \"With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-kung, \"Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"How dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I hear one point, and know a second.\"  ","The Master said, \"You are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him.\"  ","Tsai Yu being asleep during the daytime, the Master said, \"Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?\"  ","The Master said, \"At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.  ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"On what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?\"  ","The Master said, \"He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan.\"  ","The Master said of Tsze-ch'an that he had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in serving his superior, he was respectful; in nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just.\"  ","The Master said, \"Yen P'ing knew well how to maintain friendly intercourse. The acquaintance might be long, but he showed the same respect as at first.\"  ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills made, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.-Of what sort was his wisdom?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked, saying, \"The minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance. Thrice he retired from office, and manifested no displeasure. He made it a point to inform the new minister of the way in which he had conducted the government; what do you say of him?\" The Master replied. \"He was loyal.\" \"Was he perfectly virtuous?\" \"I do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Tsze-chang proceeded, \"When the officer Ch'ui killed the prince of Ch'i, Ch'an Wan, though he was the owner of forty horses, abandoned them and left the country. Coming to another state, he said, 'They are here like our great officer, Ch'ui,' and left it. He came to a second state, and with the same observation left it also;-what do you say of him?\" The Master replied, \"He was pure.\" \"Was he perfectly virtuous?\" \"I do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Chi Wan thought thrice, and then acted. When the Master was informed of it, he said, \"Twice may do.\"  ","The Master said, \"When good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of a wise man. When his country was in disorder, he acted the part of a stupid man. Others may equal his wisdom, but they cannot equal his stupidity.\"  ","When the Master was in Ch'an, he said, \"Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"Po-i and Shu-ch'i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the resentments directed towards them were few.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who says of Weishang Kao that he is upright? One begged some vinegar of him, and he begged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.\"  ","Yen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, \"Come, let each of you tell his wishes.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"I should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur clothes, to share them with my friends, and though they should spoil them, I would not be displeased.\"  ","Yen Yuan said, \"I should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds.\"  ","Tsze-lu then said, \"I should like, sir, to hear your wishes.\" The Master said, \"They are, in regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is all over. I have not yet seen one who could perceive his faults, and inwardly accuse himself.\"  ","The Master said, \"In a hamlet of ten families, there may be found one honorable and sincere as I am, but not so fond of learning.\" ","The Master said, \"There is Yung!-He might occupy the place of a prince.\" ","Chung-kung asked about Tsze-sang Po-tsze. The Master said, \"He may pass. He does not mind small matters.\"  ","Chung-kung said, \"If a man cherish in himself a reverential feeling of the necessity of attention to business, though he may be easy in small matters in his government of the people, that may be allowed. But if he cherish in himself that easy feeling, and also carry it out in his practice, is not such an easymode of procedure excessive?\" ","The Master said, \"Yung's words are right.\"  The Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn. ","Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger; he did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not such another. I have not yet heard of any one who loves to learn as he did.\"  ","Tsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch'i, the disciple Zan requested grain for his mother. The Master said, \"Give her a fu.\" Yen requested more. \"Give her a yi,\" said the Master. Yen gave her five ping. ","The Master said, \"When Ch'ih was proceeding to Ch'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich.\" ","Yuan Sze being made governor of his town by the Master, he gave him nine hundred measures of grain, but Sze declined them.  ","The Master said, \"Do not decline them. May you not give them away in the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and villages?\"  ","The Master, speaking of Chung-kung, said, \"If the calf of a brindled cow be red and homed, although men may not wish to use it, would the spirits of the mountains and rivers put it aside?\"  ","The Master said, \"Such was Hui that for three months there would be nothing in his mind contrary to perfect virtue. The others may attain to this on some days or in some months, but nothing more.\" ","Chi K'ang asked about Chung-yu, whether he was fit to be employed as an officer of government. The Master said, \"Yu is a man of decision; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" K'ang asked, \"Is Ts'ze fit to be employed as an officer of government?\" and was answered, \"Ts'ze is a man of intelligence; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\" And to the same question about Ch'iu the Master gave the same reply, saying, \"Ch'iu is a man of various ability.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family sent to ask Min Tsze-ch'ien to be governor of Pi. Min Tszech'ien said, \"Decline the offer for me politely. If any one come again to me with a second invitation, I shall be obliged to go and live on the banks of the Wan.\"  ","Po-niu being ill, the Master went to ask for him. He took hold of his hand through the window, and said, \"It is killing him. It is the appointment of Heaven, alas! That such a man should have such a sickness! That such a man should have such a sickness!\"  ","The Master said, \"Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\"  ","Yen Ch'iu said, \"It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\" The Master said, \"Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-hsia, \"Do you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the mean man.\" ","Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, \"Have you got good men there?\" He answered, \"There is Tan-t'ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on public business.\"  ","The Master said, \"Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, \"It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance.\"  ","The Master said, \"Without the specious speech of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escape in the present age.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\"  ","Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.\"  ","The Master said, \"A cornered vessel without corners-a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. ","\"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing  anything about them?\" ","The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with Wan. ","The Master, having heard of it, said, \"He deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\" ","The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, \"Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\" ","Confucius said, \"The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral  temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with  such officers as these, how should he lose his state?\" ","The Master said, \"He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\" ","Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \"Chan  Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.\" ","The duke said, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.\" Confucius retired, and said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers,  I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, \"Inform  the chiefs of the three families of it.\" ","He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\" ","Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \"Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.\" ","The Master said, \"The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\" ","The Master said, \"In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. ","Tsze-kung said, \"Master, that is what you yourself say.\" Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said,  \"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? ","Confucius said, \"I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\" ","The Master said, \"A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\" ","Some one said, \"What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\" ","The Master said, \"With what then will you recompense kindness?\" \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\" ","The Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Tsze-kung said, \"What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has  simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water  must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.'\" ","The Master said, \"How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without  speaking?\" ","The Master said, \"Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? ","\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\" ","Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash. The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.\" ","The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools.  When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among  its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its  scholars.\" ","Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. ","The Master said, \"Follow the seasons of Hsia. \"Ride in the state carriage of Yin. \"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau. \"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious;  specious talkers are dangerous.\" ","The Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" ","The Master said, \"It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" ","The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\" ","The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can indeed do nothing with him!\" ","The Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs is indeed a hard case.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a superior man.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.\" ","The Master said, \"What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the man.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?\" The Master said, \"Is not Reciprocity such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.\" ","The Master said, \"In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual. ","\"This people supplied the ground why the three dynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.\" ","The Master said, \"Even in my early days, a historiographer would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to another to ride. Now, alas! there are no such things.\" ","The Master said, \"Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great plans.\" ","The Master said, \"When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.\" ","The Master said, \"A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.\" ","The Master said, \"To have faults and not to reform them,-this, indeed, should be pronounced having faults.\" ","The Master said, \"I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking. It was of no use. better plan is to learn.\" ","The Master said, \"The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man's knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will lose again. ","\"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the people will not respect him. ","\"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of propriety:-full excellence is not reached.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great concerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.\" ","The Master said, \"Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Let every man consider virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the performance of it even to his teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely.\" ","The Master said, \"A minister, in serving his prince, reverently discharges his duties, and makes his emolument a secondary consideration.\" ","The Master said, \"In teaching there should be no distinction of classes.\" ","The Master said, \"Those whose courses are different cannot lay plans for one another.\" ","The Master said, \"In language it is simply required that it convey the meaning.\" ","The music master, Mien, having called upon him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, \"Here are the steps.\" When they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon, he said, \"Here is the mat.\" When all were seated, the Master informed him, saying, \"So and so is here; so and so is here.\" ","The music master, Mien, having gone out, Tsze-chang asked, saying. \"Is it the rule to tell those things to the music master?\" ","The Master said, \"Yes.

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, \"Our chief,  Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? \"Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with attacking it? \" ","Zan Yu said, \"Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers  wishes it.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. ","\"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. ","\"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\" ","Confucius said, \"When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies,  music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven.  When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations. ","\"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the great officers. ","\"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the common people.\" ","Confucius said, \"The revenue of the state has left the ducal house now for five generations. The government has been in the hands of the great  officers for four generations. On this account, the descendants of the  three Hwan are much reduced.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship with the uplight; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:-these are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious.  To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:-these are advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;-this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak;-this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-this is called blindness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages. ","\"The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of sages.\" ","Confucius said, \"Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those who learn, and so readily get possession of knowledge, are the next. Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn;-they are the lowest of the people.\" ","Confucius said, \"The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be  sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should  be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of  righteousness.\" ","Confucius said, \"Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, as I have heard such words. ","\"Living in retirement to study their aims, and practicing righteousness to carry out their principles:-I have heard these words, but I have not seen such men.\" ","The Duke Ching of Ch'i had a thousand teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the people did not praise him for a single virtue. Po-i and Shu-ch'i died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang mountains,  and the people, down to the present time, praise them. ","\"Is not that saying illustrated by this?\" Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, \"Have you heard any lessons from your  father different from what we have all heard?\" ","Po-yu replied, \"No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, 'Have you learned the Odes?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, If you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the Odes. ","\"Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, 'Have you learned the rules of Propriety?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, 'If you do not learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and learned the rules of Propriety. ","\"I have heard only these two things from him.\" Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, \"I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son.\" ","The wife of the prince of a state is called by him Fu Zan. She calls herself Hsiao T'ung. The people of the state call her Chun Fu Zan, and, to the people of other states, they call her K'wa Hsiao Chun. The people of other states also call her Chun Fu Zan. ","Yang Ho wished to see Confucius, but Confucius would not go to see him. On this, he sent a present of a pig to Confucius, who, having chosen a time when Ho was not at home went to pay his respects for the gift. He met him, however, on the way. ","Ho said to Confucius, \"Come, let me speak with you.\" He then asked, \"Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in his bosom, and leaves his country to confusion?\" Confucius replied, \"No.\" \"Can he be called wise, who is anxious to be engaged in public employment, and yet is constantly losing the opportunity of being so?\" Confucius again said, \"No.\" \"The days and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us.\" Confucius said,  \"Right; I will go into office.\" ","The Master said, \"By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.\" ","The Master said, \"There are only the wise of the highest class, and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot be changed.\" ","The Master, having come to Wu-ch'ang, heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing. ","Well pleased and smiling, he said, \"Why use an ox knife to kill a fowl?\" ","Tsze-yu replied, \"Formerly, Master, I heard you say,-'When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily ruled.'\" ","The Master said, \"My disciples, Yen's words are right. What I said was only in sport.\" ","Kung-shan Fu-zao, when he was holding Pi, and in an attitude of rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who was rather inclined to go. ","Tsze-lu was displeased. and said, \"Indeed, you cannot go! Why must you think of going to see Kung-shan?\" ","The Master said, \"Can it be without some reason that he has invited ME? If any one employ me, may I not make an eastern Chau?\" ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect virtue. Confucius said, \"To be able to practice five things everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue.\" He begged to ask what they were, and was told, \"Gravity,  generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose trust in you. If you are  earnest, you will accomplish much. If you are kind, this will enable you to employ the services of others. ","Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go. Tsze-lu said, \"Master, formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will not associate with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what shall be said?\" ","The Master said, \"Yes, I did use these words.

There is the love of being sincere without the love of learning;-the  beclouding here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There is the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to extravagant conduct.\" ","The Master said, \"My children, why do you not study the Book of Poetry? ","\"The Odes serve to stimulate the mind. \"They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation. \"They teach the art of sociability. \"They show how to regulate feelings of resentment. \"From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one's father, and the remoter one of serving one's prince.

The man who has not studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?\" The Master said, \"'It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say.-'It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all that is meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say.-'It is music,' they say.

When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them.

I hate the way in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families.\" ","The Master said, \"I would prefer not speaking.\" Tsze-kung said, \"If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your  disciples, have to record?\" ","The Master said, \"Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything?\" ","Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the bearer of this message went out at the door, the Master took his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him. ","Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough. ","\"If the superior man,\" said he, \"abstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.\" ","The Master said, \"If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?\" \"I should,\" replied Wo. ","The Master said, \"If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his  parents?\" ","The Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han.

Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair.

While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field-allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of eight mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State, where these results were seen, the old wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.\"","The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. ","(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. ","Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. ","Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful. ","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. ","So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. ","Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. ","All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). ","The work is done, but how no one can see; 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be. ","Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. ","Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. ","He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal. ","The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! ","We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! ","I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God. ","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to move.","DEDICATION To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De' Medici: Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.","Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to your Magnificence.","And although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance, nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and with so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments whatever, with which so many are accustomed to embellish their works; for I have wished either that no honour should be given it, or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable.","Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to understand that of princes it needs to be of the people.","Take then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain that greatness which fortune and your other attributes promise.","And if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your eyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.","THE PRINCE HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities.","Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new.","The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of the King of Spain.","Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.","CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to principalities.","In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.","I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.","We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions.","For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.","CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES But the difficulties occur in a new principality.","And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse.","This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.","In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them.","For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.","For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince.","It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places.","Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.","Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este.","He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.","Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time.","The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.","Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not.","When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves.","He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.","But when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.","This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it.","Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them.","Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him.","He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.","The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry.","A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled.","In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt.","Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.","But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt.","For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.","Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already.","The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants.","And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power.","So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there.","He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country.","And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.","The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.","Greece appears to me sufficient for an example.","The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country.","Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure.","Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy.","Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.","See remark in the introduction on the word \"intrattenere.\"","But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned.","I will speak of Louis (and not of Charles) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.","Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\" born 1462, died 1515.","Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.","King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention.","I will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes.","The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend.","Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.","Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful.","But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna.","It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority.","And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.","And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.","The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.","Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it.","And if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.","Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies.","Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage.","And if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage.","And if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage and for the cap to Rouen, to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.","Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.","The Archbishop of Rouen.","He was Georges d'Amboise, created a cardinal by Alexander VI.","Born 1460, died 1510.","Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them.","Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural.","And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness.","And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them.","From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.","WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.","I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince.","Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection.","Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.","The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France.","The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses.","But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril.","Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it.","The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him.","This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.","Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.","The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change.","Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed.","Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.","Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him.","After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons.","And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.","But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France.","Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors.","And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.","When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.","CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you.","Because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.","There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans.","The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy; nevertheless they lost them.","The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them.","They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed.","So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them.","And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget.","And whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines.","But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves.","For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily.","But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.","CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE'S OWN ARMS AND ABILITY Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate.","A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it.","Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.","I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state.","Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.","Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest.","Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.","But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples.","And although one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God.","But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.","And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them.","Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.","It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage.","It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland.","It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.","Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians dispersed.","These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.","Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease.","The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security.","And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.","This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.","Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.","It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force?","In the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely endangered.","Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed.","Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion.","And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by force.","If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long--as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe.","Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.","To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.","This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince.","He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.","This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.","Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.","CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit.","Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens came to empire.","Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them--two most inconstant and unstable things.","Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.","States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.","\"Le radici e corrispondenze,\" their roots (i.e.","foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other states--a common meaning of \"correspondence\" and \"correspondency\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.","Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia.","Francesco, by proper means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble.","On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.","Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466.","He married Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his own elevation to the duchy.","Machiavelli was the accredited agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478- 1507) during the transactions which led up to the assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left an account, written ten years before \"The Prince,\" of the proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,\" etc., a translation of which is appended to the present work.","Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building.","If, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.","Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties.","Firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians.","Besides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following.","It behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states.","This was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis.","Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander.","He was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king.","The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same.","Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack.","And as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.","For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke.","After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house.","This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia.","From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French.","Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.","Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself.","And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.","Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.","When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it necessary to give it a good governor.","Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d'Orco, a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power.","This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success.","Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates.","And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister.","Under this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side.","The barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.","Ramiro d'Orco.","Ramiro de Lorqua.","But let us return whence we started.","I say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him.","And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.","It was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.","Such was his line of action as to present affairs.","But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways.","Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope.","Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed.","Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself.","Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock.","Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three.","For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college.","And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection.","And as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa.","After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.","But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword.","He left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto death.","Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have overcome all difficulties.","And it is seen that his foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month.","In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect anything against him.","If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected.","But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander, everything would have been different to him.","On the day that Julius the Second was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.","Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.","Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.","When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government.","Because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs.","Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.","Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs.","For men injure either from fear or hatred.","Those whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.","The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having relations with him.","Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula.","He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived.","Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.","San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario.","Ascanio is Ascanio Sforza.","CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics.","These methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince of his country.","And speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other modern--and without entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.","Agathocles, the Sicilian, became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position.","This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life.","Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse.","Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily.","One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion.","And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse.","The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.","Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.","Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers.","Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory.","Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.","Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.","What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.","In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military profession.","After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession.","But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo.","So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.","Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo.","When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him.","No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest.","After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince.","He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours.","And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above.","Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.","Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war.","I believe that this follows from severities being badly or properly used.","Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.","The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease.","Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did.","It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.","Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of Machiavelli's thought when he speaks of \"crudelta\" than the more obvious \"cruelties.\"","Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits.","He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs.","For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.","And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.","CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness.","I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles.","Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.","A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions.","The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.","He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking.","But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.","Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed.","It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number.","The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail.","Further, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him.","Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not.","Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.","But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.","Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him.","But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection.","Because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.","Nabis, Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile.","And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on the people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali in Florence.","But granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.","Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus in 195 B.C.","; killed 192 B.C.","Messer Giorgio Scali.","This event is to be found in Machiavelli's \"Florentine History,\" Book III.","These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates.","In the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust.","For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few.","And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once.","Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.","CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others.","And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls.","The first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur.","In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.","And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his people.","The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year's eating, drinking, and firing.","And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.","Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with.","And whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.","Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence.","For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive.","Therefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and defend them.","CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.","These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves.","Such principalities only are secure and happy.","But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.","Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.","Before Charles, King of France, passed into Italy, this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines.","These potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory.","Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.","To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless.","And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances.","And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini.","This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.","Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.","Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke.","And although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.","Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander's time.","Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy.","All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person.","He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them.","For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons.","For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.","Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de' Medici.","HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them.","We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin.","The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws.","I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.","I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.","Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy.","The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you.","They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.","Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related.","And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.","\"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\"","This is one of the _bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the country.","Cf.","\"The History of Henry VII,\" by Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind of a felicity of a dream.","He passed the whole length of Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.\"","I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms.","The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.","And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command.","And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms.","Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free.","The Switzers are completely armed and quite free.","Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.","After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.","Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio, allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters.","His father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom.","And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere.","One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion.","Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other.","Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples.","But let us come to that which happened a short while ago.","The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown.","If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him.","The Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly.","This was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy.","And in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him.","They had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of Pitigliano,(&amp;) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble.","Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.","Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.","Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of Naples.","(%) Giovanni Acuto.","An English knight whose name was Sir John Hawkwood.","He fought in the English wars in France, and was knighted by Edward III;

and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers.","The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.","They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers.","They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom.","They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter.","All these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.","Alberigo da Conio.","Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio in Romagna.","He was the leader of the famous \"Company of St George,\" composed entirely of Italian soldiers.","He died in 1409.","CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE'S OWN Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain, for his assistance with men and arms.","These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.","Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples), surnamed \"The Catholic,\" born 1452, died 1516.","And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner.","But his good fortune brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.","The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles.","The Emperor of Constantinople, to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels.","Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.","Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you.","In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour.","The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.","I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions.","This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men.","And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.","I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above.","This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.","I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject.","David offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife.","In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.","Charles the Seventh, the father of King Louis the Eleventh, having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry.","Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them.","Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others.","The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one's own forces.","And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.","Charles VII of France, surnamed \"The Victorious,\" born 1403, died 1461.","Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.","But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers.","Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few.","And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.","\"Many speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence.","When Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under the weight of its military obligations, he said that this was 'wholly unhistorical.'","He might well have added that the Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer recognized.\"","--Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.","I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it.","And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.","And one's own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries.","And the way to make ready one's own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.","THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank.","And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states.","And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art.","Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.","For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on.","Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants.","Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together.","And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them.","He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.","As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care.","Which knowledge is useful in two ways.","Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others.","And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.","Philopoemen, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage?","How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks?","If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\"","And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.","Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks,\" born 252 B.C., died 183 B.C.","But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus.","And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon.","A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.","CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends.","And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people.","But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.","Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.","Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like.","And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them.","And again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.","CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal.","Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite.","Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get money.","This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.","Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.","We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed.","Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness.","The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal.","A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.","And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one.","In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government.","And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others.","In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality.","And to the prince who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers.","And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.","And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated.","And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both.","Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.","CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.","Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency.","Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty.","And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.","Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.","During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.","And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers.","Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying: \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"","Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.",".",".",".","against my will, my fate A throne unsettled, and an infant state, Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs, And guard with these severities my shores.","Christopher Pitt.","Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved?","It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.","Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.","And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.","Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women.","But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.","Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse.","But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.","Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune.","This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect.","And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them.","That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline.","For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery.","The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature.","Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.","This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.","Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.","CHAPTER XVIII -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH \"The present chapter has given greater offence than any other portion of Machiavelli's writings.\"","Burd, \"Il Principe,\" p. 297.","Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft.","Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word.","You must know there are two ways of contesting, the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second.","Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man.","This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable.","A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.","Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.","Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about.","Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer.","If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them.","Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance.","Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.","\"Contesting,\" i.e.","\"striving for mastery.\"","Mr Burd points out that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero's \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\"","But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.","One recent example I cannot pass over in silence.","Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes, because he well understood this side of mankind.","\"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).\"","The words \"ad votum\" are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.","Alexander never did what he said, Cesare never said what he did.","Italian Proverb.","Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.","And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.","And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity, and religion.","Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.","\"Contrary to fidelity\" or \"faith,\" \"contro alla fede,\" and \"tutto fede,\" \"altogether faithful,\" in the next paragraph.","It is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro alla fede\" and \"tutto fede,\" were omitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal authorities.","It may be that the meaning attached to the word \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e.","the Catholic creed, and not as rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\"","Observe that the word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot heresy.","South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed.","1843, comments on this passage as follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe, Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political scheme: 'That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.'\"","For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious.","There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.","Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.","For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.","One prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.","Ferdinand of Aragon.","\"When Machiavelli was writing 'The Prince' it would have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand's name here without giving offence.\"","Burd's \"Il Principe,\" p. 308.","THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.","It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain.","And when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.","It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.","That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.","For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers.","From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.","But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length.","And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite.","And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.","And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire.","For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.","Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers.","Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni, who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi.","This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.","Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508.","He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506.","Machiavelli's strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.","For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody.","And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.","Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king.","Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom.","From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands.","And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.","It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them.","Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.","It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.","There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty.","Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people.","Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful.","Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.","From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.","But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration.","And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.","But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.","Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied.","And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.","Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started.","On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian.","After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne.","And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus.","To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.","But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him.","Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life.","He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.","But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies.","Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria.","He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion.","And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.","Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor's ruin.","But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.","It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus.","He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne.","This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity.","First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.","I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.","From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends.","The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends.","But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen.","And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.","But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones.","Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps.","Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.","ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?","1.","Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them.","And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.","2.","There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents.","And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you.","But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you.","And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.","Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms.","Histories are full of examples.","But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.","3.","Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.","This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.","The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them.","Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state.","Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.","4.","Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised.","For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.","5.","Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted.","Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others.","But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs.","And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them.","And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.","6.","It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack.","I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly.","Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision.","Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another.","And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone.","The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state.","For this reason the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.","It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli, when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people.","But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners.","Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses.","All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.","Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509.","It was to the Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499.","A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when.","They tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me at once.\"","Cf.","\"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini, translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.","HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example.","We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present King of Spain.","He can almost be called a new prince, because he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary.","In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions.","He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them.","He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.","Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare.","Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them.","And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.","Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.","And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.","A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.","In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you.","Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.","Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans.","He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms.","This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral.","To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\"","Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms.","And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined.","But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you.","Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to justice.","But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.","In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion.","And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one.","The Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could have been avoided.","But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.","Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.","A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art.","At the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state.","Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies, he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.","\"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\"","\"Arti\" were craft or trade guilds, cf.","Florio: \"Arte .",".",".","a whole company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\"","The guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).","Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf.","Sir Mackenzie Wallace's \"Russia,\" ed.","1905: \"The sons .",".",".","were always during the working season members of an artel.","In some of the larger towns there are artels of a much more complex kind-- permanent associations, possessing large capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual members.\"","The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or \"arte.\"","Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental company.\"","In both words the underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath.","\"Tribu\" were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included individuals connected by marriage.","Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\" would be most appropriate.","CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince.","And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful.","But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.","There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant.","Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.","Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.","But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.","On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances.","When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.","HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating.","It is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt.","Because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, respect for you abates.","Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.","With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions.","He who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt.","I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example.","Fra Luca, the man of affairs to Maximilian, the present emperor, speaking of his majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.","This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them.","But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them.","Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.","Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.","He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in Italian politics.","A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.","And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man.","In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him.","But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them.","Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them.","And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.","Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.","WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there.","For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things.","Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.","And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles.","In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.","Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.","Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them.","This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you.","This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.","WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let chance govern them.","This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture.","Sometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.","Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions, but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.","Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this miserable universe.\"","Sorel's \"Eastern Question.\"","I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous.","So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.","And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence.","For if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all.","And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.","But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character.","This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes.","I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful.","Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method.","One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.","This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.","Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action.","But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.","Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success.","Consider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive.","The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him.","Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.","Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.","I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.","I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out.","For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly.","She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.","AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.","And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.","Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered.","It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies.","It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.","Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house, with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption.","This will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.","And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.","Giuliano de Medici.","He had just been created a cardinal by Leo X.","In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement VII.","With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in them.","Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention.","Further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest.","God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.","And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us have known how to find a new one.","And nothing honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.","Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.","Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.","Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety.","But when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him.","Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.","The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.","If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers.","And although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his expense.","Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour.","And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them.","For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat.","Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry.","And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them.","It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old.","And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince.","This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear.","Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.","What door would be closed to him?","Who would refuse obedience to him?","What envy would hinder him?","What Italian would refuse him homage?","To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks.","Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch: Virtu contro al Furore Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto: Che l'antico valore Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.","Virtue against fury shall advance the fight, And it i' th' combat soon shall put to flight: For the old Roman valour is not dead, Nor in th' Italians' brests extinguished.","Edward Dacre, 1640.","DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.","These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy.","Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena.","Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined.","And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they sent their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy.","This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.","Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means.","The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress.","Upon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.","Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.","But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies.","The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.","But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.","This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.","Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them.","When this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.","And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill.","But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna.","In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.","And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so.","On the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.","This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.","But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia.","To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.","It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there.","This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions.","And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons.","di Candales, his brother-in-law.","He left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends.","But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.","Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke's quarters, where they should be seized.","The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there.","He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.","Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places.","The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile.","On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road.","Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia.","If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely.","Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.","The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above.","Matters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.","Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement.","And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them.","He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind.","These three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.","But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape.","Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke.","And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.","So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.","Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.","But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it.","Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled.","Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo.","Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce.","After which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.","THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI And sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328 It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.","They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity.","It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted.","I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her.","Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show.","It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men.","I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.","The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world.","To this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio.","He had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother.","Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty.","One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant.","Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother.","Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home.","When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister.","They discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up.","They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child.","They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father.","As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him.","Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood.","As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys.","In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men.","Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.","There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca.","He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca.","This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken.","Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was.","Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him.","Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church.","Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier.","This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.","Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman.","In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity.","But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors.","These gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca.","When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.","Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.","Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose.","About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate.","Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.","Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions.","Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party.","This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence.","Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.","The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord.","There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione.","Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi.","Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need.","When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis.","Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side.","Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters.","The governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time.","Of those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.","As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca.","They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca.","Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia.","Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.","Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy.","Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.","This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident.","Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used.","On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio.","Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them.","First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands.","Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre.","Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him.","He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings.","Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other.","By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.","So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour.","The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto.","On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.","This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it.","Being of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it.","This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.","On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped.","This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio.","He therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death.","Castruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison.","But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.","Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord.","Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him.","But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.","They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty.","Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison.","Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.","But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year.","Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana.","To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town.","With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana.","In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it.","After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people.","And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.","At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen.","Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love for the memory of his father.","Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany.","At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.","Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.","Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany.","All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance.","Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.","Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts.","As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa.","While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto.","Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.","Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.","Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.","There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca.","They found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.","They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired.","Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up.","Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.","Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city.","As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house.","To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception.","He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality.","Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death.","Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.","He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it.","A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made.","Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted.","Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.","Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere.","It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire.","He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him.","Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia.","Each of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows.","Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance.","He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi.","At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends.","Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction.","Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts.","The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.","About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.","The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them.","This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope.","Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.","Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome.","Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction.","In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.","When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.","Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator.","This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\"","Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"","During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence.","Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger.","These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom.","The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia.","When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia.","Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories.","On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle.","He believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand.","Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.","Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.","The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.","For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position.","It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand.","As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.","Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo.","Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning.","In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning.","Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle.","The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle.","Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors.","It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through.","When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion.","The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done.","In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance.","Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends.","When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy.","These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy.","Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety.","The defeat was complete and very sanguinary.","Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.","Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio.","He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence.","Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women.","He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines.","He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi.","This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it.","He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.","Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese.","He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison.","As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.","This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa.","Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile.","It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples.","When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy.","They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.","In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato.","When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle.","He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry.","Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.","Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio's forces except at a disadvantage.","In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard.","In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.","The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter.","The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen.","On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry.","Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno.","The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move.","When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing.","These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry.","The horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion.","The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield.","The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains.","Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few.","At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left.","This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.","But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river.","The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry.","This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy.","This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight.","The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army.","But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless.","Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory.","Many captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli.","If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle.","Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.","But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him.","Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them.","He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it.","Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death.","On the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal.","Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows: \"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa.","I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries.","But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation.","But Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it.","Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness.","When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show.","And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.","Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.","Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under thy government.","Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.","Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them.","Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany.","In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming.","Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee.","And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security.","It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace.","And it will be well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true.","And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\"","After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died.","He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was.","His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca.","Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities.","Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca.","This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.","From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date.","In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned.","He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased.","His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat.","He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it.","No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself.","He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong.","He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him.","It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions.","He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\"","\"That is true,\" answered the friend.","Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less to me.\"","Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded.","When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\"","Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\"","A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\"","Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\"","Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything.","Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth.","Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.\"","To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.\"","Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated.","Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the same.\"","Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not taken me in, I have taken her.\"","Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\"","and being told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\"","Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.","Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.\"","Being asked how Caesar died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\"","Being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\"","A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked.","Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded.","Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.\"","Having been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.\"","He used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands.","To an envious man who laughed, he said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?\"","Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\"","Castruccio answered: \"A helmet.\"","Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy.","Castruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came.","He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her.","He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\"","On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno.","He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\"","Seeing one of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I pray God that you will let him feed you also.\"","Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house from the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\"","Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\"","He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king.","\"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?\"","asked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?\"","I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities.","He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince.","And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity.","As in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or

Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth.

The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.

He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.

In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort.

If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace.

He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous.

Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard.

Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\"  ","Yen Ch'iu said, \"It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\" The Master said, \"Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-hsia, \"Do you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the mean man.\" ","Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, \"Have you got good men there?\" He answered, \"There is Tan-t'ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on public business.\"  ","The Master said, \"Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, \"It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance.\"  ","The Master said, \"Without the specious speech of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escape in the present age.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\"  ","Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.\"  ","The Master said, \"A cornered vessel without corners-a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. ","\"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing  anything about them?\" ","The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with Wan. ","The Master, having heard of it, said, \"He deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\" ","The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, \"Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\" ","Confucius said, \"The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral  temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with  such officers as these, how should he lose his state?\" ","The Master said, \"He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\" ","Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \"Chan  Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.\" ","The duke said, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.\" Confucius retired, and said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers,  I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, \"Inform  the chiefs of the three families of it.\" ","He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\" ","Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \"Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.\" ","The Master said, \"The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\" ","The Master said, \"In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. ","Tsze-kung said, \"Master, that is what you yourself say.\" Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said,  \"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? ","Confucius said, \"I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\" ","The Master said, \"A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\" ","Some one said, \"What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\" ","The Master said, \"With what then will you recompense kindness?\" \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\" ","The Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Tsze-kung said, \"What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has  simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water  must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.'\" ","The Master said, \"How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without  speaking?\" ","The Master said, \"Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? ","\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\" ","Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash. The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.\" ","The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools.  When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among  its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its  scholars.\" ","Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. ","The Master said, \"Follow the seasons of Hsia. \"Ride in the state carriage of Yin. \"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau. \"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious;  specious talkers are dangerous.\" ","The Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" ","The Master said, \"It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" ","The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\" ","The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can indeed do nothing with him!\" ","The Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs is indeed a hard case.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a superior man.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.\" ","The Master said, \"What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the man.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?\" The Master said, \"Is not Reciprocity such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.\" ","The Master said, \"In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual.

Now, alas! there are no such things.\" ","The Master said, \"Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great plans.\" ","The Master said, \"When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.\" ","The Master said, \"A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.\" ","The Master said, \"To have faults and not to reform them,-this, indeed, should be pronounced having faults.\" ","The Master said, \"I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking. It was of no use. better plan is to learn.\" ","The Master said, \"The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man's knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will lose again. ","\"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the people will not respect him.

The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.\" ","The Master said, \"Virtue is more to man than either water or fire.

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, \"Our chief,  Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? \"Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with attacking it? \" ","Zan Yu said, \"Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers  wishes it.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. ","\"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. ","\"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\" ","Confucius said, \"When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies,  music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven.  When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations.

In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be  sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should  be reverently careful.

Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?\" ","The Master said, \"He who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like one of the small, mean people;-yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?\" ","The Master said, \"Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue.\" ","The Master said, To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"There are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one's prince! ","\"While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them. ","\"When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, there is nothing to which they will not proceed.\" ","The Master said, \"Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. ","\"The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness.  The stupidity of antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.\" ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"I hate the manner in which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the way in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families.\" ","The Master said, \"I would prefer not speaking.\" Tsze-kung said, \"If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your  disciples, have to record?\" ","The Master said, \"Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything?\" ","Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the bearer of this message went out at the door, the Master took his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him. ","Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough. ","\"If the superior man,\" said he, \"abstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.\" ","The Master said, \"If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?\" \"I should,\" replied Wo. ","The Master said, \"If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his  parents?\" ","The Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea. ","The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \"The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great  ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure.

If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people.

There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor.

While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor.

If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven.

Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk.

","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.

philosopher Yu said, \"They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. ","\"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\"  ","Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.  ","The Master said, \"I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\"  ","Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'\" ","The Master said, \"Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.

In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\"  ","The Master said: \"He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?\"  ","The Master said, \"A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one.

If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.  ","The Master said of Tsze-chien, \"Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?\"  ","Tsze-kung asked, \"What do you say of me, Ts'ze!\" The Master said, \"You are a utensil.\" \"What utensil?\" \"A gemmed sacrificial utensil.\" ","Some one said, \"Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\"  ","The Master said, \"What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?\"  ","The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \"I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this.\" The Master was pleased.  ","The Master said, \"My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\" Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \"Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \"I do not know.\"  ","He asked again, when the Master replied, \"In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"And what do you say of Ch'iu?\" The Master replied, \"In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"What do you say of Ch'ih?\" The Master replied, \"With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-kung, \"Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"How dare I compare myself with Hui?

This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?\"  ","The Master said, \"At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.

The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.\"  ","The Master said, \"A cornered vessel without corners-a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung.

He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North.

They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue.

When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places.

When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations.

He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his  parents?\" ","The Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea. ","The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \"The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great  ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty.

As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk.

The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to

philosopher Yu said, \"They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. ","\"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\"  ","Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.  ","The Master said, \"I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\"  ","Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'\" ","The Master said, \"Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.  ","\"If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name?  ","\"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\"  ","The Master said: \"He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?\"  ","The Master said, \"A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known.\"  ","The Master said, \"Shan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity.\" The disciple Tsang replied, \"Yes.\"  ","The Master went out, and the other disciples asked, saying, \"What do his words mean?\" Tsang said, \"The doctrine of our master is to be true to the principles-of our nature and the benevolent exercise of them to others,-this and nothing more.\"  ","The Master said, \"The mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with gain.\" ","The Master said, \"When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.\"  ","The Master said, \"While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.  ","The Master said of Tsze-chien, \"Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?\"  ","Tsze-kung asked, \"What do you say of me, Ts'ze!\" The Master said, \"You are a utensil.\" \"What utensil?\" \"A gemmed sacrificial utensil.\" ","Some one said, \"Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\"  ","The Master said, \"What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?\"  ","The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \"I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this.\" The Master was pleased.  ","The Master said, \"My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\" Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \"Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \"I do not know.\"  ","He asked again, when the Master replied, \"In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"And what do you say of Ch'iu?\" The Master replied, \"In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"What do you say of Ch'ih?\" The Master replied, \"With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-kung, \"Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"How dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I hear one point, and know a second.\"  ","The Master said, \"You are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him.\"  ","Tsai Yu being asleep during the daytime, the Master said, \"Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?\"  ","The Master said, \"At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.  ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"On what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?\"  ","The Master said, \"He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan.\"  ","The Master said of Tsze-ch'an that he had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in serving his superior, he was respectful; in nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just.\"  ","The Master said, \"Yen P'ing knew well how to maintain friendly intercourse. The acquaintance might be long, but he showed the same respect as at first.\"  ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills made, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.-Of what sort was his wisdom?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked, saying, \"The minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance. Thrice he retired from office, and manifested no displeasure.

How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Tsze-chang proceeded, \"When the officer Ch'ui killed the prince of Ch'i, Ch'an Wan, though he was the owner of forty horses, abandoned them and left the country.

How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\" ","Chi Wan thought thrice, and then acted. When the Master was informed of it, he said, \"Twice may do.\"  ","The Master said, \"When good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of a wise man. When his country was in disorder, he acted the part of a stupid man. Others may equal his wisdom, but they cannot equal his stupidity.\"  ","When the Master was in Ch'an, he said, \"Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves.\"  ","The Master said, \"Po-i and Shu-ch'i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the resentments directed towards them were few.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who says of Weishang Kao that he is upright? One begged some vinegar of him, and he begged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him;-Tso Ch'iu-ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.\"  ","Yen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, \"Come, let each of you tell his wishes.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"I should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur clothes, to share them with my friends, and though they should spoil them, I would not be displeased.\"  ","Yen Yuan said, \"I should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds.\"  ","Tsze-lu then said, \"I should like, sir, to hear your wishes.\" The Master said, \"They are, in regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is all over. I have not yet seen one who could perceive his faults, and inwardly accuse himself.\"  ","The Master said, \"In a hamlet of ten families, there may be found one honorable and sincere as I am, but not so fond of learning.\" ","The Master said, \"There is Yung!-He might occupy the place of a prince.\" ","Chung-kung asked about Tsze-sang Po-tsze.

Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side.

The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North.

When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words.

They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue.

How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. ","\"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. ","\"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\" ","Confucius said, \"When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies,  music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven.  When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations. ","\"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the great officers.

Friendship with the uplight; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:-these are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious.  To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:-these are advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are injurious.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;-this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak;-this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-this is called blindness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness.\" ","Confucius said, \"There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages.

In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be  sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should  be reverently careful.

A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea. ","The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \"The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great  ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh.

Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty.

Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk.

The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name.

","Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. ","Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful. ","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. ","So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. ","Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. ","All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results).

","Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. ","Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. ","He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal. ","The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! ","We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! ","I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God. ","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.

Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness.

","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to

Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth.

The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.

He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.

In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort.

If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace.

He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous.

Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard.

Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\"  ","Yen Ch'iu said, \"It is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\" The Master said, \"Those whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-hsia, \"Do you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the mean man.\" ","Tsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch'ang, the Master said to him, \"Have you got good men there?\" He answered, \"There is Tan-t'ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on public business.\"  ","The Master said, \"Mang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, \"It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance.\"  ","The Master said, \"Without the specious speech of the litanist T'o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is difficult to escape in the present age.\"  ","The Master said, \"Who can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\"  ","Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.\"  ","The Master said, \"A cornered vessel without corners-a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side. ","\"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing  anything about them?\" ","The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with Wan. ","The Master, having heard of it, said, \"He deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\" ","The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, \"Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\" ","Confucius said, \"The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral  temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with  such officers as these, how should he lose his state?\" ","The Master said, \"He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\" ","Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i. Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \"Chan  Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish him.\" ","The duke said, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of it.\" Confucius retired, and said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers,  I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, \"Inform  the chiefs of the three families of it.\" ","He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \"Following in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\" ","Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \"Do not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his face.\" ","The Master said, \"The progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\" ","The Master said, \"In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. ","Tsze-kung said, \"Master, that is what you yourself say.\" Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said,  \"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker? ","Confucius said, \"I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\" ","The Master said, \"A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\" ","Some one said, \"What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\" ","The Master said, \"With what then will you recompense kindness?\" \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\" ","The Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Tsze-kung said, \"What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has  simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water  must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.'\" ","The Master said, \"How determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without  speaking?\" ","The Master said, \"Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? ","\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\" ","Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash. The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.\" ","The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools.  When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among  its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its  scholars.\" ","Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. ","The Master said, \"Follow the seasons of Hsia. \"Ride in the state carriage of Yin. \"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau. \"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious;  specious talkers are dangerous.\" ","The Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" ","The Master said, \"It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" ","The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\" ","The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can indeed do nothing with him!\" ","The Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs is indeed a hard case.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a superior man.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.\" ","The Master said, \"What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the man.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?\" The Master said, \"Is not Reciprocity such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.\" ","The Master said, \"In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual.

Now, alas! there are no such things.\" ","The Master said, \"Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great plans.\" ","The Master said, \"When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.\" ","The Master said, \"A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.\" ","The Master said, \"To have faults and not to reform them,-this, indeed, should be pronounced having faults.\" ","The Master said, \"I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking. It was of no use. better plan is to learn.\" ","The Master said, \"The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man's knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will lose again. ","\"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the people will not respect him.

The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.\" ","The Master said, \"Virtue is more to man than either water or fire.

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, \"Our chief,  Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? \"Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with attacking it? \" ","Zan Yu said, \"Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers  wishes it.\" ","Confucius said, \"Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil. ","\"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it. ","\"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\" ","Confucius said, \"When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies,  music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven.  When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three  generations.

In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be  sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should  be reverently careful.

Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?\" ","The Master said, \"He who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like one of the small, mean people;-yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?\" ","The Master said, \"Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue.\" ","The Master said, To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"There are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one's prince! ","\"While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them. ","\"When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, there is nothing to which they will not proceed.\" ","The Master said, \"Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. ","\"The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness.  The stupidity of antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.\" ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"I hate the manner in which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the way in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families.\" ","The Master said, \"I would prefer not speaking.\" Tsze-kung said, \"If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your  disciples, have to record?\" ","The Master said, \"Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything?\" ","Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the bearer of this message went out at the door, the Master took his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him. ","Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough. ","\"If the superior man,\" said he, \"abstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.\" ","The Master said, \"If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?\" \"I should,\" replied Wo. ","The Master said, \"If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his  parents?\" ","The Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea. ","The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \"The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great  ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure.

If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people.

There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor.

While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor.

If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven.

Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk.

","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.

philosopher Yu said, \"They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.  ","\"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\"  ","The Master said, \"Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\" ","The Master said, \"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\"  ","Tsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.  ","The Master said, \"If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.  ","\"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.  \"Have no friends not equal to yourself.  \"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  The philosopher Tsang said, \"Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.\"  ","Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, \"When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?\" ","The Master said, \"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.  ","\"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\"  ","The philosopher Yu said, \"When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?\" The Master replied, \"They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\"  ","The Master said, \"With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"  ","The Master said, \"In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.  ","\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\"  ","The Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. ","\"At thirty, I stood firm.  \"At forty, I had no doubts.  \"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.  \"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth.

The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"  ","Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'\"  ","Fan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\"  ","Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\"  ","Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?\" ","Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\"  ","The Master said, \"I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.\" ","The Master said, \"See what a man does.  \"Mark his motives.  \"Examine in what things he rests.  \"How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.\" ","The Master said, \"The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\" ","Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\"  ","The Master said, \"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\"  ","The Master said, \"The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge.\" ","Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument. ","The Master said, \"Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\"  ","The Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" ","Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, \"Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\"  ","Some one addressed Confucius, saying, \"Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?\"  ","The Master said, \"What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?\" ","The Master said, \"I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.\" ","The Master said, \"For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.  ","\"To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\" ","Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \"If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?\"  ","The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, \"'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?\" ","The Master said, \"If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\" ","Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies. ","The Master said, \"A great question indeed!  \"In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\"  ","The Master said, \"The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them.\"  ","The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \"Can you not save him from this?\" He answered, \"I cannot.\" Confucius said, \"Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?\"  ","The Master said, \"The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\"  ","Tsze-hsia asked, saying, \"What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'\"  ","The Master said, \"The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\"  ","\"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?\" The Master said, \"It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him.\"  ","The Master said, \"I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words.\"  ","The Master said, \"At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\"  ","Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \"I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\"-pointing to his palm.  ","He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.

He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\"  ","The Master said, \"Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau.\" ","The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \"Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\" The Master heard the remark, and said, \"This is a rule of propriety.\"  ","The Master said, \"In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way.\"  ","Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.  ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\" ","The Master said, \"The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery.\" ","The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, \"A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness.\" ","The Master said, \"The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive.\" ","The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \"The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\" ","When the Master heard it, he said, \"Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\" ","The Master said, \"Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\" ","Some one said, \"Was Kwan Chung parsimonious?\" \"Kwan,\" was the reply, \"had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\"  ","\"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\" The Master said, \"The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\"  ","The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \"How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\"  ","The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \"When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\" The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, \"My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue.\" ","The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.  ","The Master said, \"High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\"  ","The Master said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\"  ","The Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\"  ","The Master said, \"Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.

In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.  ","\"Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient. ","\"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\" ","The Master said, \"The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\"  ","The Master said, \"A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\"  ","The Master said: \"He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\"  ","The Master said, \"If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?\"  ","The Master said, \"A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one.

If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\"  ","The Master said, \"The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear.\" ","The Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"  The Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\"  ","Tsze-yu said, \"In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant.\" ","The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.  ","Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.  ","The Master said of Tsze-chien, \"Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?\"  ","Tsze-kung asked, \"What do you say of me, Ts'ze!\" The Master said, \"You are a utensil.\" \"What utensil?\" \"A gemmed sacrificial utensil.\" ","Some one said, \"Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\"  ","The Master said, \"What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?\"  ","The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \"I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this.\" The Master was pleased.  ","The Master said, \"My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\" Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \"Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\"  ","Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \"I do not know.\"  ","He asked again, when the Master replied, \"In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"And what do you say of Ch'iu?\" The Master replied, \"In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","\"What do you say of Ch'ih?\" The Master replied, \"With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\"  ","The Master said to Tsze-kung, \"Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\"  ","Tsze-kung replied, \"How dare I compare myself with Hui?

This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?\"  ","The Master said, \"At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen a firm and unbending man.\" Some one replied, \"There is Shan Ch'ang.\" \"Ch'ang,\" said the Master, \"is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\" The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you have not attained to that.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\"  ","When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else.

The acquaintance might be long, but he showed the same respect as at first.\"  ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills made, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.-Of what sort was his wisdom?\"  ","Tsze-chang asked, saying, \"The minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance.

If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the effect of mere good fortune.\" ","The Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\"  ","The Master said, \"To those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\"  ","Fan Ch'ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \"To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\" He asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\"  ","The Master said, \"Ch'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true principles predominated.\"  ","The Master said, \"A cornered vessel without corners-a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\"  ","Tsai Wo asked, saying, \"A benevolent man, though it be told him,-'There is a man in the well\" will go in after him, I suppose.\" Confucius said, \"Why should he do so?\" A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he cannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\"  ","The Master said, \"The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\"  ","The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\"  ","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its practice among the people.\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\" The Master said, \"Why speak only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.  ","\"Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.  ","\"To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue.\"  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","The Master said, \"A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old P'ang.\" ","The Master said, \"The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one of these things belongs to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\"  ","When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.  ","The Master said, \"Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.\" ","The Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. ","\"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. ","\"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.  \"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" ","The Master said, \"From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.\" ","The Master said, \"I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\" ","When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.  ","He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping. ","The Master said to Yen Yuan, \"When called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have attained to this.\"  ","Tsze-lu said, \"If you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\"  ","The Master said, \"I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\"  ","The Master said, \"If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\"  ","The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.  ","When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \"I did not think'\" he said, \"that music could have been made so excellent as this.\"  ","Yen Yu said, \"Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?\" Tsze-kung said, \"Oh! I will ask him.\"  ","He went in accordingly, and said, \"What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch'i?\" \"They were ancient worthies,\" said the Master. \"Did they have any repinings because of their course?\" The Master again replied, \"They sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, \"Our Master is not for him.\"  ","The Master said, \"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\"  ","The Master said, \"If some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without great faults.\"  ","The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.  ","The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.  ","The Master said, \"Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming on?\"  ","The Master said, \"I am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.\" ","The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. ","The Master said, \"When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\"  ","The Master said, \"Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T'ui-what can he do to me?\"  ","The Master said, \"Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\"  ","There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.  ","The Master said, \"A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\"  ","The Master said, \"A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.  ","\"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\"  ","The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds perching.  ","The Master said, \"There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\"  ","It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.  ","The Master said, \"I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\"  ","The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \"He knew propriety.\"  ","Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come forward, and said, \"I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?\"  ","Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \"I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to know them.\"  ","When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.  ","The Master said, \"In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\"  ","The Master said, \"The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\"  ","The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \"May such a thing be done?\" Tsze-lu replied, \"It may. In the Eulogies it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.'\" The Master said, \"My praying has been for a long time.\"  ","The Master said, \"Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\"  ","The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.  ","The Master said, \"T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\"  ","The Master said, \"Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.  ","\"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\" ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \"Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, my little children.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was. ","Tsang said to him, \"When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.  ","\"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Gifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\"  ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is long.  ","\"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not long? ","The Master said, \"It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. ","\"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. ","\"It is from Music that the finish is received.\"  The Master said, \"The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.\"  ","The Master said, \"The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\"  ","The Master said, \"With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his course. ","\"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed. ","\"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\"  ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the ears!\"  ","The Master said, \"Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not understand.\" ","The Master said, \"Learn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose it.\"  ","The Master said, \"How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them! ","The Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.  ","\"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\"  ","Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed. ","King Wu said, \"I have ten able ministers.\"  Confucius said, \"Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more than nine men.  ","\"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\"  ","The Master said, \"I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\"  ","The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue. ","A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \"Great indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\"  ","The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \"What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\"  ","The Master said, \"The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.  ","\"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\" ","There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang.  He said, \"After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  ","\"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang do to me?\"  ","A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \"May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\"  ","Tsze-kung said, \"Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.\" ","The Master heard of the conversation and said, \"Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.'\"  ","The Master said, \"Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\" ","The Master said, \"The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!\"  ","When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily. ","Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, \"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.  ","\"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety. ","\"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.\"  ","The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.  ","During a remission of his illness, he said, \"Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? ","\"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?\" The Master said, \"Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\"  ","The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.  ","Some one said, \"They are rude. How can you do such a thing?\" The Master said, \"If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?\"  ","The Master said, \"I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\"  ","The Master said, \"Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?\"  ","The Master standing by a stream, said, \"It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\"  ","The Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\"  ","The Master said, \"The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.\"  ","The Master said, \"Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.\" The Master said of Yen Yuan, \"Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\"  ","The Master said, \"A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.\" ","The Master said, \"Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\" ","The Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\"  ","The Master said, \"The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.\"  ","The Master said, \"Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!  ","\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!\" ","Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \"Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\"  ","The Master said, \"When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\" ","The Master said, \"The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\"  ","The Master said, \"There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.\"  ","\"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\"  ","The Master said, \"It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\" ","Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.  ","When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.  ","When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.  ","When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.  ","When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.  ","He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.  ","He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird. ","When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \"The visitor is not turning round any more.\"  ","When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.  ","When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the threshold. ","When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.  ","He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not breathe.  ","When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.  ","When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the ground.  ","In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.  ","At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.  The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.  ","Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.  ","In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. ","Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.  ","The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short. ","He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body. ","When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger. ","When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle. ","His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below. ","He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence. ","On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.  ","When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment. ","He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.  ","He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in season.  ","He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.  ","Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused by it.  ","He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market. ","He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much. ","When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.  ","When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak. ","Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful air. ","If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.  When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immediately after.  ","When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps.  ","When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away. ","Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \"I do not know it. I dare not taste it.\"  ","The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \"Has any man been hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses. ","When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.  ","When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.  ","When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle across them.  ","When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.  ","When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.  ","When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \"I will bury him.\"  ","When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.  ","The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. ","In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.  ","When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.  ","To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of population.  ","When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise up. ","On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance. ","When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.  ","When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands. ","Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.  ","The Master said, \"There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.  ","The Master said, \"The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen. ","\"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\"  ","The Master said, \"Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\"  ","Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia. ","The Master said, \"Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\"  ","The Master said, \"Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and brothers.\" ","Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to wife. ","Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \"There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.  ","The Master said, \"Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \"Alas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \"Master, your grief is excessive!\" ","\"Is it excessive?\" said he. \"If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"  ","When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \"You may not do so.\"  ","The disciples did bury him in great style.  The Master said, \"Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\"  ","Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \"While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?\" Chi Lu added, \"I venture to ask about death?\" He was answered, \"While you do not know life, how can you know about death?\"  ","The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased. ","He said, \"Yu, there!-he will not die a natural death.\"  Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury. ","Min Tsze-ch'ien said, \"Suppose it were to be repaired after its old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?\"  ","The Master said, \"This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\"  ","The Master said, \"What has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\" ","The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \"Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner apartments.\"  ","Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \"Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.\"  ","\"Then,\" said Tsze-kung, \"the superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\" ","The Master said, \"To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\" ","The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his wealth. ","The Master said, \"He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\"  ","Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse. ","The Master said, \"There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.  ","\"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often correct.\" ","Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \"He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\"  ","The Master said, \"If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\"  ","Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \"There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?\" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, \"Immediately carry into practice what you hear.\" Kung-hsi Hwa said, \"Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\" The Master said, \"Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back.\"  ","The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \"I thought you had died.\" Hui replied, \"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?\" ","Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.  ","The Master said, \"I thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!  ","\"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, retires. ","\"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\" ","Tsze-zan said, \"Then they will always follow their chief;-win they?\" ","The Master said, \"In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\"  ","Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.  The Master said, \"You are injuring a man's son.\"  Tsze-lu said, \"There are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\" ","The Master said, \"It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\"  ","Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master. ","He said to them, \"Though I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.  ","\"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?\"  ","Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \"Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\" The Master smiled at him.  ","Turning to Yen Yu, he said, \"Ch'iu, what are your wishes?\" Ch'iu replied, \"Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to do that.\"  ","\"What are your wishes, Ch'ih,\" said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, \"I do not say that my ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant.\"  ","Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \"Tien, what are your wishes?\" Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \"My wishes,\" he said, \"are different from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen.\" \"What harm is there in that?\" said the Master; \"do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.\" Tien then said, \"In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\" The Master heaved a sigh and said, \"I give my approval to Tien.\"  ","The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \"What do you think of the words of these three friends?\" The Master replied, \"They simply told each one his wishes.\"  ","Hsi pursued, \"Master, why did you smile at Yu?\"  He was answered, \"The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him.\"  ","Hsi again said, \"But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for himself?\" The reply was, \"Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\"  ","Once more, Hsi inquired, \"And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed for himself?\" The Master again replied, \"Yes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great one?  ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect  virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" ","Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master  replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\" ","\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty of  doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\" ","Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\" ","\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what we call the superior man?\" ","The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\" ","Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, I only have not.\" ","Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I have  heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors  depend upon Heaven.' ","\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?\" ","Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements  that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military  equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military  equipment,\" said the Master. ","Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ","Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantial  qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental  accomplishments?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\" ","The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\" ","Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\" \"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do with that system of one tenth?\" ","Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\" ","Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way to exalt one's virtue. ","\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a difference.'\" ","The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius  replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister  is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\" ","\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\" ","The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle  litigations!\" ","Tsze-lu never slept over a promise. The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" ","Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\" ","The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\" ","Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\" ","Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confucius  replied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing  at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will  be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between  the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across  it.\" ","Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\" ","The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\" Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\" ","The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction. \"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves  righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan. ","\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.\" ","Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\" ","The Master said, \"Truly a good question! \"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail  one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love all men.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\" ","Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these answers. The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be upright.\" ","Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he mean?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying! \"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue  disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue  disappeared.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,  stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \"Go before the people with your example, and be laborious in their affairs.\" ","He requested further instruction, and was answered, \"Be not weary in these things.\" ","Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \"Employ first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\" ","Chung-kung said, \"How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\" He was answered, \"Raise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" ","The Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" ","The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. ","\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. ","\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. ","\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ","Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \"I am not so good for that as an old husbandman.\" He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \"I am not so good for that as an old  gardener.\" ","Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, \"A small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?\" ","The Master said, \"Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\" ","The Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal  conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be  followed.\" ","The Master said, \"The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\" The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, \"Ha! here is a collection-!\" When they were a little increased, he said, \"Ha! this is complete!\" When he had become rich, he said, \"Ha! this is  admirable!\" ","When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. The Master observed, \"How numerous are the people!\" Yu said, \"Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\" \"Enrich them, was the reply. ","\"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\" The Master said, \"Teach them.\" ","The Master said, \"If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\" ","The Master said, \"'If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this saying!\" ","The Master said, \"If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail.\" ","The Master said, \"If a minister make his own conduct correct, what  difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify  himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\" ","The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \"How are you so late?\" He replied, \"We had government business.\" The Master said, \"It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,  though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\" ","The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, \"Such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence. ","\"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.' ","\"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his country?\" ","The duke then said, \"Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\" Confucius replied, \"Such an effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!' ","\"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\" ","The Duke of Sheh asked about government. The Master said, \"Good government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" ","Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \"Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\" ","The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \"Among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\" ","Confucius said, \"Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.\" ","Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere.  Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, \"He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.\" ","Tsze-kung pursued, \"I venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\" And he was told, \"He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be  fraternal.\" ","Again the disciple asked, \"I venture to ask about the class still next in order.\" The Master said, \"They are determined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class.\" ","Tsze-kung finally inquired, \"Of what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\" The Master said \"Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\" ","The Master said, \"Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\" ","The Master said, \"The people of the south have a saying -'A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' Good! ","\"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\" The Master said, \"This arises simply from not attending to the  prognostication.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\" ","Tsze-kung asked, saying, \"What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master replied, \"We may not for that accord our approval of him.\" \"And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?\" The Master said, \"We may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with  right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them  according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy  to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not  accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to everything.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" ","The Master said, \"The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\" ","Tsze-lu asked, saying, \"What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\" The Master said, \"He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,  bland.\" ","The Master said, \"Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war.\" ","The Master said, \"To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\" ","Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \"When good government  prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is shameful.\" ","\"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"This may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect virtue.\" ","The Master said, \"The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" ","The Master said, \"When good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.\" ","The Master said, \"The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\" ","Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \"I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\" The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, \"A superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\" ","The Master said, \"Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\" ","The Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" ","The Master said, \"In preparing the governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\" ","Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, \"He was a kind man.\" ","He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \"That man! That man!\" He asked about Kwan Chung. \"For him,\" said the Master, \"the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to eat.\" ","The Master said, \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" ","The Master said, \"Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and  music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man.\" ","He then added, \"But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.\" ","The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \"Is it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes not?\" ","Kung-ming Chia replied, \"This has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his taking.\" The Master said, \"So! But is it so with him?\" ","The Master said, \"Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\" ","The Master said, \"The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\" ","The Master said, \"The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like  his?\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\" ","The Master said, \"Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole kingdom.

Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others.\" ","Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. \"What,\" said he! \"is your  master engaged in?\" The messenger replied, \"My master is anxious to make  his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\" He then went out, and the  Master said, \"A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\" ","The Master said, \"He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\" ","The Master said, \"The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\" ","The Master said, \"The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear.

Now, I have not leisure for this.\" ","The Master said, \"I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability.\" ","The Master said, \"He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?\" ","Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \"Ch'iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating talker?

I do not grumble  against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there  is Heaven;-that knows me!\" ","The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, \"Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court.\" ","The Master said, \"If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\" ","The Master said, \"Some men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\" ","The Master said, \"Those who have done this are seven men.\" Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \"Whom do you come from?\" Tsze-lu said, \"From Mr. K'ung.\" \"It is he,-is it not?\"-said the other, \"who knows the impracticable nature of the times and yet will be doing in them.\" ","The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius was, and said, \"His heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\" ","A little while after, he added, \"How contemptible is the one-ideaed  obstinacy those sounds display!

The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.\" ","The Master said, \"When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on them for service.\" ","Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness.\" \"And is this all?\" said Tsze-lu. \"He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\" was the reply. \"And is this all?\" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \"He  cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates  himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still  solicitous about this.\" ","Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \"In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-this is to be a pest.\" With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. ","A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, \"I suppose he has made great progress.\" ","The Master said, \"I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.\" ","The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military  matters.\" On this, he took his departure the next day. ","When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers  became so in that they were unable to rise. ","Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \"Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\" The Master said, \"The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.\" ","The Master said, \"Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?\" \"No,\" was the answer; \"I seek a unity all pervading.\" The Master said, \"Yu I those who know virtue are few.\" The Master said, \"May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently  without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\" ","Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. ","The Master said, \"Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood? ","\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\" ","Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash. The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words.\" ","The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\" ","Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools.  When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among  its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its  scholars.\" ","Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered. ","The Master said, \"Follow the seasons of Hsia. \"Ride in the state carriage of Yin. \"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau. \"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes.

The songs of Chang are licentious;  specious talkers are dangerous.\" ","The Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" ","The Master said, \"It is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" ","The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\" ","The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this?

How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' ","\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\" ","Zan Yu said, \"But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his  descendants.\" ","Confucius said. \"Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their conduct. ","\"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings. ","\"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil.

When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed  from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not  lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations.

","Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough. ","\"If the superior man,\" said he, \"abstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.\" ","The Master said, \"If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?\" \"I should,\" replied Wo. ","The Master said, \"If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.\" ","Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \"This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his  parents?\" ","The Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" ","Tsze-lu said, \"Does the superior man esteem valor?\" The Master said, \"The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without  righteousness, will commit robbery.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Has the superior man his hatreds also?\" The Master said, \"He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted  understanding.\" ","The Master then inquired, \"Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?\" Tsze-kung replied, \"I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\" ","The Master said, \"Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\" ","The Master said, \"When a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\" ","The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died. ","Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\" ","Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?\" ","The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"I am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure. ","The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took his departure. ","The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\" ","Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him. ","Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford. ","Ch'ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\" Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K'ung Ch'iu.', \"Is it not K'ung of Lu?\" asked he. \"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\" ","Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" He answered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\" asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping. ","Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.\" ","Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed. ","Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,  prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons. ","Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone. ","Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great  relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs  the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that.\" ","The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,  Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien. ","The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch'i. ","\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in them. ","\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,  they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they  acted according to the exigency of the times. ","\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am  predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\" ","The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. ","Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea. ","The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \"The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great  ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\" ","To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,  Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa. ","Tsze-chang said, \"The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed ","Tsze-chang said, \"When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\" ","The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, \"What does  Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\" They replied, \"Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate  with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do  so.'\" Tsze-chang observed, \"This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great  talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.  Therefore, the superior man does not practice them.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\" Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence,  they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence  of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying him.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues.\" ","Tsze-yu said, \"The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding,  are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\" ","Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \"Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\" ","Tsze-hsia said, \"My friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"How imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice virtue.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I heard this from our Master: 'Men may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\" ","The philosopher Tsang said, \"I have heard this from our Master:-'The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent  to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his  father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.'\" ","The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\" ","Tsze-kung said, \"The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes  again, and all men look up to him.\" ","Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \"From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\" ","Tsze-kung replied, \"The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular  master?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying,  \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" ","Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is  valuable in the apartments. ","\"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. ","\"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?\" ","Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \"It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity. ","Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \"You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?\" ","Tsze-kung said to him, \"For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. ","\"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair. ","\"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly  lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?\" ","Yao said, \"Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.\" ","Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu. T'ang said, \"I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the  sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\" ","Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. \"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One man.\" ","He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course. ","He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him. ","What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices. ","By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted. ","Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\" ","Tsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great  expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so  that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic  without being fierce?\" ","Tsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" ","The Master said, \"Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. ","\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established. ","\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" ","What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.","The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.","Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.","The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.","Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.","From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.","It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.","Commentary of the philosopher Tsang","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\"","In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\"","In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\"","These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious.","On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\"","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\"","Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this bird?\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Profound was King Wan. With how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting places!\" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten.","The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root.","This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge.","What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone.","The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\"","Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make his thoughts sincere.","What is meant by, \"The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress.","When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat.","This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.","What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred.","Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\"","This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family.","What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry.","From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies the saying, \"Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may be settled by its One man.\"","Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them.","Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.","This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\"","What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct.","What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\"","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom.","In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.","On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.","Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine.","Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people.","And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same.","In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it.","In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good men.\"","Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, \"Our fugitive does not account that to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his parent.\"","In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, \"Let me have but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\"","It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\"","To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.","To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so.","Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it.","There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient.","The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life.","Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not continue in the sovereign's possession.","The officer Mang Hsien said, \"He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues.\" This is in accordance with the saying:-\"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates again the saying, \"In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness.\"","What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.","The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.","There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful over himself, when he is alone.","While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.","Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish.","Chung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.","\"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, and has no caution.\"","The Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice it!","The Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up to it.","\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish flavors.\"","The Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"","The Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he was Shun!\"","The Master said \"Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"","The Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\"","The Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained to.\"","Tsze-lu asked about energy. The Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?","\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study.","\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.","\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"","The Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not do.","\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.","\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is only the sage who is able for this.\"","The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret.","Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the fishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above and below.","The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.","The Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, this course cannot be considered The Path.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as they change what is wrong, he stops.","\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.","\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man?\"","The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this.","In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself.","In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men.","Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.","The Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"","The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower ground.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"","The Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"","The Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!","\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.","\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.","\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'","\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\"","The Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.","\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.","\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it overthrows.","\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'","\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure to receive the appointment of Heaven.\"","The Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted it.","\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to himself.","\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.","The Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu and the duke of Chau!","\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.","\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their various robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.","\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.","\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed as they would have served them had they been continued among them.","\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his palm!\"","The Duke Ai asked about government. The Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and ceases.","\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called an easily-growing rush.","\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of benevolence.","\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of propriety.","\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.","\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge of Heaven.","\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.","\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes to the same thing.\"","The Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling of shame is to be near to energy.","\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern the kingdom with all its states and families.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes of the states.","\"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is brought to revere him.","\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states.","\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness.","\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.","\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.","\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.","\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.","\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor.

While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.","\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"","When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity.","It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.","Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform.","It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit.","Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself.","Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing.","The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.","Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.","Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.","Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.","So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.","Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends.","The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable.","The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.","The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.","How great is the path proper to the Sage! Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven.","All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.","It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\"","Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.","Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\"","The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come.","To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.","Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules.","One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music.","The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"","He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government.","However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules.","Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings.","His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.","Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him.","It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.","Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.","He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining.","All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great.","It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.","All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues.","All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him.","Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"","It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he depends?","Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!","Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, possessing all Heavenly virtue?","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts a plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility.","It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 'That is perfect virtue.\"","Mencius went to see King Hwuy of L\u00ebang. The king said, \"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come here a distance of a thousand li, may presume that you are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty used that word 'profit'? What am likewise provided with are counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are my only topics.","\"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?' Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance; but if righteousness be put last and profit first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.","\"There never was a man trained to benevolence who neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration. Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness your only themes--Why must you speak of profit?\"","When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of L\u00ebang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small, said, \"Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these things?\" Mencius replied, \"Being wise and good, they then have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\" It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':--","'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower, He planned it, and defined it, And the people in crowds undertook the work, And in no time completed it. When he planned the commencement, he said, \"Be not in a hurry.\" But the people came as if they were his children. The king was in the Marvellous park, Where the does were lying down-- The does so sleek and fat; With the white birds glistening. The king was by the Marvellous pond;-- How full was it of fishes leaping about!'","King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond 'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer, his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.","\"In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people wished for K\u00ebeh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, remove as many of the people as can to the east of it, and convey grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east of the river, act on the same plan. On examining the governmental methods of the neighboring kingdoms, do not find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as do. And yet the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor do my people increase--how is this?\"","Mencius replied, \"Your Majesty loves war; allow me to take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these, because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those who ran a hundred paces?\" The king said, \"They cannot do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they also ran.\" Mencius said, \"Since your Majesty knows this you have no ground to expect that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.","\"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and do all offices for their dead, without any feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal way.","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been that the ruler of a State where these results were seen, persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.","\"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not know to store up of the abundance. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say, 'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year,' In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people, all under the sky, will come to you.\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"wish quietly to receive your instructions.\" Mencius replied, \"Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword?\" \"There is no difference,\" was the answer.","Mencius continued, \"Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?\" \"There is not,\" was the answer again.","Mencius then said, \"In your stalls there are fat beasts; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?\"","King Hwuy of L\u00ebang said, \"There was not in the kingdom a stronger State than Ts'in, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were defeated by Ts'e, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts'oo. have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?\"","Mencius replied, \"With a territory only a hundred li square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed with sticks which they have prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons of the troops of Ts'in and Ts'oo.","\"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger; elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent has no enemy!' beg your Majesty not to doubt what said.\"","Mencius had an interview with King S\u00ebangof L\u00ebang. When he came out he said to some persons, \"When looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a ruler; when drew near to him, saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom, all under the sky, be settled?' replied, 'It will be settled by being united under one sway,'","\"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.","\"replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.'","\"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.","\"replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the sky would be looking towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"","King Seuen of Ts'e asked, saying, \"May be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts'e and Wan of Ts'in?\"","Mencius replied, \"There were none of the disciples of Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining to the Royal sway.\"","The king said, \"Of what kind must his virtue be who can attain to the Royal sway?\" Mencius said, \"If he loves and protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from attaining it.\"","The king said, \"Is such an one as poor competent to love and protect the people?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"From what do you know that am competent to that?\" \"have heard,\" said Mencius, \"from Hoo Heih the following incident:--'The king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall, when some people appeared leading a bull past below it. The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell with its blood, he said, \"Let it go, cannot bear its frightened appearance--as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death.\" They asked in reply whether, if they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell, but the king said, \"How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\"' do not know whether this incident occurred.\"","\"It did,\" said the king, and Mencius replied, \"The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress which made you do as you did.\"","The king said, \"You are right; and yet there really was an appearance of what the people imagined. But though Ts'e be narrow and small, how should grudge a bull? Indeed it was because could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore changed it for a sheep.\"","Mencius said, \"Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudged the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between a bull and a sheep?\" The king laughed and said, \"What really was my mind in the matter? did not grudge the value of the bull, and yet changed it for a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that grudged the creature.\"","Mencius said, \"There is no harm in their saying so. It was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps away from his stalls and kitchen.\"","The king was pleased and said, \"The Ode says,","'What other men have in their minds, can measure by reflection,'","This might be spoken of you, my Master. indeed did the thing, but when turned my thoughts inward and sought for it, could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?\"","Mencius said, \"Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but do not see a wagon-load of fagots,' would your Majesty allow what he said?\" \"No,\" was the king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, \"Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people--how is this? is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was not used; and the people's not being loved and protected is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do not do it, and not because you are not able to do it.\"","The king asked, \"How may the difference between him who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be graphically set forth?\" Mencius replied, \"In such a thing as taking the T'ae mountain under your arm, and leaping with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people, 'am not able to do it,' it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the T'ae mountain under your arm and leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.","\"Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly treated--do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'","'His example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and States;'","Telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?","\"By weighing we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires specially to be so. beg your Majesty to measure it.--Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment of the various princes--do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?\"","The king said, \"No. How should derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what greatly desire.\"","Mencius said, \"May hear from you what it is that your Majesty greatly desires?\" The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed, \"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?\" \"No,\" said the king, \"my desire is not on account of them.\" Mencius observed, \"Then what your Majesty greatly desires can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories, to have Ts'in and Ts'oo coming to your court, to rule the Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.\"","\"Is it so bad as that?\" said the king. \"apprehend it is worse,\" was the reply. \"If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.\" The king said, \"May hear what they will be?\" Mencius replied, \"If the people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts'oo, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?\" \"The people of Ts'oo would conquer,\" was the answer, and Mencius pursued, \"So then, a small State cannot contend with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the weak contend with the strong. The territory within the seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li square. All Ts'e together is one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsow's contending with Ts'oo? With the desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.","\"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?\"","The king said, \"am stupid and cannot advance to this. But wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly, and although am deficient in intelligence and vigor, should like to try at least to institute such a government.\"","Mencius replied, \"They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?\"","\"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness.","\"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; even in good years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances their only object is to escape from death, and they are afraid they will not succeed in doing so--what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?","\"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government, why not turn back to what is the essential step to its attainment?","\"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years will be able to eat flesh.

It has never been that the ruler of a State, where these results were seen, the old wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.\"","The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. ","(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. ","Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. ","Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful. ","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. ","So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. ","Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. ","All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). ","The work is done, but how no one can see; 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be. ","Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. ","Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. ","He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal. ","The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! ","We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! ","I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God. ","Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. ","May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? ","'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free. ","The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain. ","Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. ","Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised? ","The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. ","The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. ","And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him. ","It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. ","When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. ","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. ","In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? ","(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao). ","the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness. ","Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; ","Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. ","Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. ","Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). ","What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? ","Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. ","We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. ","Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. ","We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. ","The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. ","Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. ","Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. ","They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete. ","The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. ","The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay. ","In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). ","How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!' ","When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. ","When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared. ","If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. ","Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew. ","When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! ","The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). ","The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. ","How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao). ","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. ","Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. ","That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it. ","Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! ","Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. ","Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others). ","He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them. ","There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. ","I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. ","Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. ","Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is. ","Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. ","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne. ","The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' ","Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.' ","Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. ","Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. ","Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. ","The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures. ","If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. ","The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence. ","He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. ","Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. ","A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. ","When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end. ","Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. ","The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. ","On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites. ","The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. ","Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. ","Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. ","As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. ","The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys. ","He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. ","He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity. ","All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. ","All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. ","Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them. ","To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. ","Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible. ","When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' ","The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. ","Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people. ","The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. ","If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. ","If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. ","Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. ","---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). ","(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. ","(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. ","Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. ","Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. ","Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other. ","The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- ","Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). ","If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. ","Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone. ","The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. ","All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named). ","Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. ","Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- ","'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' ","The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. ","The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. ","What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. ","What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching. ","The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). ","There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. ","Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? ","Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. ","Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he. ","Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. ","Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven. ","When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. ","There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency. ","Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. ","Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so. ","He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). ","He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. ","He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven. ","The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. ","To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. ","The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. ","Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. ","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. ","There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. ","But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death. ","All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. ","This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. ","Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. ","It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation. ","(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. ","When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. ","Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. ","The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. ","Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight. ","If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. ","The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. ","Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely! ","What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. ","Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. ","In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. ","How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation). ","He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. ","(The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). ","To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) ","When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends. ","He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. ","He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' ","(Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven. ","A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. ","How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.' ","The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? ","Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. ","Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle. ","For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. ","It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. ","He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen. ","Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. ","Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. ","When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao). ","What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. ","(To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. ","Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. ","The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself. ","Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. ","(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. ","Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. ","Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing. ","(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. ","(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. ","He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties. ","That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. ","The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. ","He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. ","Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own). ","The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. ","The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. ","He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him. ","That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. ","In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. ","Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him. ","All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).  Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! ","But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. ","With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. ","Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him. ","He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. ","Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.' ","A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. ","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers. ","My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. ","There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. ","They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. ","To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. ","It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it. ","When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. ","Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. ","It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. ","Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former. ","He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But ","When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). ","It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape. ","The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? ","There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands! ","The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. ","The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. ","The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it. ","Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. ","Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. ","Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) ","Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above. ","May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. ","It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. ","Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! ","Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority. ","There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. ","Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. ","Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' ","Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical. ","When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? ","Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. ","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man. ","In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). ","Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. ","I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). ","They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. ","There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it. ","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. ","The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. ","With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive. ","Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.","5,The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.","Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? Which of the two generals has most ability? With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side are officers and men more highly trained? In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","All warfare is based on deception.","Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.","13,With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.","Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--","By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"","To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.","He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.","Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.","A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.","That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?","The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.","Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.","Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.","All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.","The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.","If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.","We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.","In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.","Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","Such is the art of warfare.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.","The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.","So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: Recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.","In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.","All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.","If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.","When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.","If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.","The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.","Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.","To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.","If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: Accessible ground; entangling ground; temporizing ground; narrow passes; precipitous heights; positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: Flight; insubordination; collapse; ruin; disorganization; rout.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: Dispersive ground; facile ground; contentious ground; open ground; ground of intersecting highways; serious ground; difficult ground; hemmed-in ground; desperate ground.","When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.","Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground","The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.","How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.","Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.","The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.","When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.","On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.","When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.","By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.","On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.","Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.","In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.","There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:","When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.","By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.","But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","SEPARATOR Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: Local spies; inward spies; converted spies; doomed spies; surviving spies.","When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.","Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.","It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to
